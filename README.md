# Node.js CRUD Application Assessment

Welcome to the Node.js CRUD Application Assessment. This assessment is designed to evaluate your skills in creating a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Node.js, Express.js, and a database of your choice. Follow the steps below to complete the assessment, and good luck!

## Objective

Your task is to build a simple CRUD API for managing user records. This includes creating users, updating user information, reading user details, and deleting users from the system.

## Steps to Complete the Assessment

1. **Fork this Repository:** Start by forking this GitHub repository to your own account. You will work on your assessment within your forked repository.

2. **Setup the Project:**
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
   - Install the necessary dependencies.

3. **Database Setup:**
   - Choose a database for storing user records (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or whatever you prefer!). Try to include instructions on how to set up and configure the database.

4. **API Development:**
   - Create RESTful API endpoints to perform the following operations:
     - Create a new user with the required fields - id, name, email, address, city, country.
     - Read user details by user ID.
     - Update user information by user ID.
     - Delete a user by user ID.

5. **Validation and Error Handling:**
   - Implement input validation to ensure data integrity.
   - Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages in the API responses.

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for your API endpoints. Consider using a testing framework like Mocha.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Document your API endpoints, including the request and response formats, in this README.md file.
   - Include instructions on how to run the application and tests.

8. **Submission:**
   - Commit your code to your forked repository.
   - Push the changes to your GitHub repository.
   - Create a Pull Request from your forked repository to this main repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your assessment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Correctness of CRUD operations.
- Proper API design and RESTful practices.
- Use of atomic commits and meaningful commit messages.
- Quality of code and unit tests.
- Code readability and organization, including proper use of comments.

## Bonus Points (Optional)

Consider these optional enhancements to earn bonus points:
- Deploy the application on a live server
